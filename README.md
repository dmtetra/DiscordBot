# **1shot** DiscordBot

## Purpose of DiscordBot

The purpose of this is to create a discord bot, for basic usage in a discord server with friends. This means that it has a variety of impractical features that are created for fun, such as a calculator, random number or even random quote generator. It also has practical features including a banned list of words, or help commands. This more or less servered as a testing ground for learning how to use python in library. I have since improved at programming, as this was made in 2021.

## Installation instructions

1. Go to discord's developer portal and set up a bot profile and generate an api token
2. Take api token and place that in the authtoken.py file
3. Run the bot, and create changes to fit your personal server
